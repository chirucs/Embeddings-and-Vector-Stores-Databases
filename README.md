## Introduction

Embeddings are essential in machine learning for converting complex data types such as text, images, and graphs into numerical vector representations. These representations allow efficient processing, search, and comparison in applications such as semantic search, recommendations, and retrieval-augmented generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Additional packages: `gensim`, `faiss`, `scikit-learn`

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Files

1. **`classifying-embeddings-with-keras.ipynb`**: Demonstrates how to use Keras to train models using embeddings for classification tasks.
2. **`embeddings-and-similarity-scores.ipynb`**: Shows methods for computing similarity scores between embeddings.
3. **`document-q-a-with-rag.ipynb`**: Implements retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using vector stores to answer questions based on documents.
